# AGENTS.md

## How to use this file
* Skim once at the start of a session to align on global policies.
* Ask the user when instructions conflict or feel unsafe.

## Models
* Prefer `gpt-5.3-codex`. If unavailable, state active model and limitations.

## Agent conduct
* Verify assumptions before executing commands; call out uncertainties first.
* Ask for clarification when the request is ambiguous, destructive, or risky.
* Summarize intent before performing multi-step fixes so the user can redirect early.
* Cite the source when using documentation; quote exact lines instead of paraphrasing from memory.
* Break work into incremental steps and confirm each step with the smallest relevant check before moving on.
